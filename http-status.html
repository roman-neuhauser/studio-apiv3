<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being
created.
The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned
in the entity of the response, with the most specific URI for the
resource given by a Location header field.</p>
<p>The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201
status code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RFC2616, 9.5 POST:</p>
<blockquote>
If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response
SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the
status of the request and refers to the new resource,
and a Location header (see section 14.30).</blockquote>
<p>RFC2616, 9.6 PUT:</p>
<blockquote>
If a new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the
user agent via the 201 (Created) response.</blockquote>

<p>The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has
not been completed.
The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it
might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.</p>
<p>The entity returned with this response SHOULD include an indication
of the request's current status and either a pointer to a status
monitor or some estimate of when the user can expect the request to
be fulfilled.</p>

<p>The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an
entity-body, and might want to return updated metainformation.
The response MAY include new or updated metainformation in the form
of entity-headers, which if present SHOULD be associated with the
requested variant.</p>
<p>The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body, and thus is
always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RFC2616, 9.5 POST:</p>
<blockquote>
The action performed by the POST method might not result in a
resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either
200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status.</blockquote>
<p>RFC2616, 9.6 PUT:</p>

<p>The requested resource corresponds to any one of a set of
representations, each with its own specific location, and agent-
driven negotiation information (section 12) is being provided so
that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred representation
and redirect its request to that location.</p>
<p>If the server has a preferred choice of representation, it SHOULD
include the specific URI for that representation in the Location
field; user agents MAY use the Location field value for automatic
redirection.</p>

<p>The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any
future references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned
URIs.</p>
<p>The new permanent URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
response.</p>
<p>If the 301 status code is received in response to a request other
than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the
request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might
change the conditions under which the request was issued.</p>

<p>RFC2616 10.3.3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD
continue to use the Request-URI for future requests.
This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or
Expires header field.</p>
<p>The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
response.
Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response
SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new
URI(s).</p>
<p>If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other
than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the

<p>RFC2616 10.3.4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response to the request can be found under a different URI and
SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method on that resource.
This method exists primarily to allow the output of a
POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected
resource.
The new URI is not a substitute reference for the originally
requested resource.</p>
<p>The different URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
response.</p>

If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is
allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD
respond with this status code.
The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is
always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.</blockquote>

continue to use the Request-URI for future requests.</p>
<p>If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other
than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the

syntax.
The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.</blockquote>

<p>RFC2616 10.4.4:</p>
<blockquote>
The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.
If the request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make
public why the request has not been fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the
reason for the refusal in the entity.
If the server does not wish to make this information available to the
client, the status code 404 (Not Found) can be used instead.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="not-found">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">404 Not Found</a></h1>
<p>RFC2616 10.4.5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI.</p>
<p>The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server
knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old
resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address.
This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to
reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other
response is applicable.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="method-not-allowed">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">405 Method Not Allowed</a></h1>
<p>RFC2616 10.4.6:</p>
<blockquote>
The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the
resource identified by the Request-URI.
The response MUST include an Allow header containing a list of
valid methods for the requested resource.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="not-acceptable">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">406 Not Acceptable</a></h1>
<p>RFC2616 10.4.7:</p>
<blockquote>
The resource identified by the request is only capable of
generating response entities which have content characteristics not
acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conflict">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">409 Conflict</a></h1>
<p>RFC2616 10.4.10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current
state of the resource.
This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected that
the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the
request.
The response body SHOULD include enough information for the user to
recognize the source of the conflict.</p>
<p>For example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT
included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an
earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response
to indicate that it can't complete the request.
In this case, the response entity would likely contain a list of
the differences between the two versions in a format defined by the
response Content-Type.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gone">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">410 Gone</a></h1>
<p>RFC2616 10.4.11:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no
forwarding address is known.
This condition is expected to be considered permanent.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources
as &quot;gone&quot; or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is
left to the discretion of the server owner.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="length-required">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">411 Length Required</a></h1>

Content-Length.</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="precondition-failed">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">412 Precondition Failed</a></h1>
<p>RFC2616 10.4.13:</p>
<blockquote>
This response code allows the client to place preconditions on the
current resource metainformation (header field data) and thus
prevent the requested method from being applied to a resource other
than the one intended.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="request-entity-too-large">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">413 Request Entity Too Large</a></h1>
<p>RFC2616 10.4.14:</p>

The server is refusing to process a request because the request
entity is larger than the server is willing or able to process.</blockquote>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">415 Unsupported Media Type</a></h1>
<p>RFC2616 10.4.16:</p>

The server is refusing to service the request because the entity of
the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource
for the requested method.</blockquote>
